problem: 

The Snake Rubik puzzle involves solving a 3x3x3 cube composed of 27 interconnected segments, where each segment is a cube linked to its neighbors by hinges. The goal is to manipulate the flexible "snake" of cubes into a perfect 3x3x3 configuration without breaking the constraints imposed by the fixed connections and hinge orientations. The problem requires careful planning and spatial reasoning to identify a sequence of rotations that aligns all segments into the target shape while adhering to the physical limits of the snake's structure. Solvers must navigate through a vast solution space, exploring feasible configurations and avoiding invalid moves, to achieve the desired cube arrangement.

Environment details: 
Actions domain: 
Each move in this puzzle consists of first selecting two adjacent pieces — i.e., a pair of consecutive numbers from 1 to 27 — and then rotating them relative to each other by 90, -90, or 180 degrees around one of the axes x, y, or z, which is the shared axis between them. Note that due to the specific way the string passes through the pieces, the rotation of two adjacent pieces relative to each other is only possible around their shared axis. 
Constraints: 
In practice, the string is sufficiently elastic such that spatial constraints preventing the beads from colliding with each other during twisting can be ignored. However, in your simulation program, completely disregard this aspect — assume the beads can pass through one another as if they were incorporeal, and there are no restrictions in this regard. 
However, certain beads are glued together, making it impossible to perform any moves between them. The glued beads are as follows: beads **5 and 6**, beads **12 and 13**, beads **14 and 15**, and beads **16 and 18** as well as **18 and 19**.
